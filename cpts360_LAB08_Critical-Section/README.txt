I know the instructions state to turn in as well the .o for critical_section
however, I am not able to because I am doing this assignment on my
mac, and mac will compile to a different format than Ubuntu will
not be able to understand (Mach-O vs. ELF). Which is why I instead provided
everything else instead.

All that needs to be done to run this on Linux Ubuntu is to
run "make" and that will generate the right object file in the ubuntu server
for grading purposes.

and macos is very hard to scp to from an ssh, when i modify files and create
then inside my elec, they are pretty much stuck there. 

Thanks for understandning,

-Raul
